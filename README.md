I Started my process by setting up all my files and just making a general outline of how I would approach this layout.

Then started coding the HTML and CSS

The biggest task for me was the cluster of images and how to lay those out properly. After a few different attempts and with the help of flexbox, I was able to lay out the images as needed. Then proceeded to add a few break points for some responsive design. 

Last task was to create the function to change the hero image with every reload of the page. Easy enough. Ran into a simple syntax bug that had me stuck for a minute. 

With my limited knowledge on the topic of slide-in animations, I wasn't properly able to compose a solution for that task in the time I allotted for myself.
